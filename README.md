# QDTP-python
qDataTransportationProtocol(python implementation)

## Version Number

v1

## Notice

### Network

Server runs on port 4582

### Working In Progress...

This is the first version of qDTP.

In fact, it's far from complete. Many necessary features are still not implemented.

But it does do the simplest work - send file to remote and fetch file from remote.

So, I'd mark the first version here, although I *WILL NOT* implement a full client for it.

Codes in *client.py* are just functions. It can't run without further implementation.
